Issues: No way for blind people to tell what floor they stop on

This is a good design because of the user feeback via light up indicators showing which buttons are pressed

For a B

Common Uses:
	Changing floors
	Moving items vertically
Rare Uses: 

Common Sequence of actions:
Call elevator in desired direction
Enter elevator and select the floor you wish to go to
Wait to reach desired floor
Exit elevator

The elevator has up to 2 call buttons on the exterior of the elevator, these buttons are usually labeled or positioned in a way that implies directions. Labeling or positioning of buttons lets the user know which button is for which direction. Upon entering the elevator, there are a sequence of buttons that are labeled to a corresponding floor. Selecting one of these buttons will cause the elevator to move to the chosen floor. These buttons are often labeled with extra descriptors in larger buildings that describe what is available on said floor. 

The elevator supports the user, with a series of chimes. For example, on most elevators when the elevator reaches a called floor it will let out one or two chimes indicating the elevator is continuing up, or continuing down respectively. These also help people who are vision impaired know which direction the elevator is going.

Common Mistakes: 
Getting in an elevator headed up and needing to go down
Not knowing what floor the elevator is stopped on
